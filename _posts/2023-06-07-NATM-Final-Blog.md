I realy liked Night at the Museum. It was a cool and unique way to show off what we have learned in all of our classes. I saw other projects in APCSP, AP Studio Art, and 3D Animation. Overall, here was my experience for all of my classes.

**AP Studio Art**: I saw all sorts of different drawings made by students. Each drawing had a different style to it and I liked most/all of them. People used different styles and I liked most if not all of them. I liked the impressive amount of creativity that the students showed.

- I have a friend who is passionate about art who is taking AP Studio Art next year and I will share what I think about these projects to him so that he can know what is to be expected.

**3D Animation**: The projects in 3D Animation really impressed me because there was a ton of different styles that people used. There was all sorts of textures that students used to impress viewers. Some people had sort of a videogameish animation (the picture below), and others had like a donut box and a cool animation to display the donut and table. I was very impressed with their designs.

**Digital Media Arts:** The students at digital media arts made a film trailer for their film that we all can see by  scanning the QR Code below. I saw some of them and they were very cool.

**Conclusion**
Night at the Museum seamlessly weaves together various subjects, including CSA, CSP, 3D Animation, and Digial Media Arts. It not only entertains but also educates, igniting a passion for learning.. Through its use of technology, computer science principles, digital artistry, the event encourages us to embrace the vast opportunities.
