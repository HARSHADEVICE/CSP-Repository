## Create Performance Task 

### Program Purpose and Function 
- The purpose of the program is to find a job based on your major and age.

### Data Abstraction
- Available jobs based on age will be stored in a list or dictionary.

### Managing Complexity 
- I used lists and dictionaries to manage complextity, so code would not repeat over and over and it will be efficient.

### Procedural Abstraction 
- Based on the age and major, jobs will be displayed. The correct jobs will be displayed for the correct major and age. The code will be organized and split into 
correct catagories. 

### Algorithm Implementation
- The code will be iterated, sequenced, and modified in order to proceed as planned (correctly). 

### Testing
- The code will go through multiple trails in order to make sure that everything is running correctly.
