## Create Performance Task 

### Program Purpose and Function 
- The purpose of the program is to find a vacation spot based on your place of residency and age.

### Data Abstraction
- Available spots will be stored by age and season. Each season and groups of age will have specific vacaction spots that are organized based on lists and dictionaries.

### Managing Complexity 
- I used lists and dictionaries to manage complextity, so code would not repeat over and over and it will be efficient.

### Procedural Abstraction 
- Based on the age and season, jobs will be displayed. The correct jobs will be displayed for the correct season and age. The code will be organized and split into 
correct catagories. 

### Algorithm Implementation
- The code will be iterated, sequenced, and modified in order to proceed as planned (correctly). 

### Testing
- The code will go through multiple trails in order to make sure that everything is running correctly.
