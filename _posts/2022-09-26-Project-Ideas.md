# Project Idea
- We decided to make some sort of a clock that displays the time zone that you are in.
- It can be made into many options such as analog, digital, or themes in which you can change into.
- The clock will also have a timer and stopwatch option to add more features.
- The clock will display min, hours, seconds, and maybe miliseconds depending upon the specs.
- Kind of like this link over here which displays an image...
