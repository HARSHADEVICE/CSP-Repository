# Collegeboard Coding Submissions Part 2

## Submission 1 

| Reporting Category      | Student Score | Collegeboard Score| Comments |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   0     |   0   | The program runs properly however the purpose states the function rather than the intended purpose of the program. The response switched the input and output vice versa.     |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 1        | 0      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and a list included. The name of both lists are mentioned and used in the code.             |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  0    | 0      | The code does not have a segment to manage complexity, neither does the response explain how the list manages complexity.              |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 0      | The code includes a student developed procedure that is used in the program and briefly explains the functionality of it.              |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 0       |  0     | The program includes a student developed algorithm however the response does not really explain how it works so that someone can replicate it.|
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls and describes the conditions being tested and the results of both calls.  |


- My Overall Grade: **3/6**
- Collegeboard Overall Grade: **1/6**

| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   1    |   1   | the program runs properly and includes an input and an output. The response explains the purpose and the functionality shown in the video.   |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and a list included. The name of both lists are mentioned and used in the code. The response also mentions what is stored within the list.            |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  1   | 1     | The code uses lists to manage complexity and the response explains why it would be different without the lists.             |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | The code includes a student developed procedure with 4 different perameters that is used in the program and briefly explains the functionality of the procedure.              |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 1       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm however the response does explain how it works so that someone can replicate it.|
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls and describes the conditions being tested and the results of both calls. The results are in detail and specified.  |


- My Overall Grade: **6/6**
- Collegeboard Overall Grade: **6/6**
- Comments: The program was excellent and Collegeboard and I gave it the same score.

| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 0        | 0      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and a list included, but the data stored in the list is not being used.           |

| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 0       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm however the procedure name is different which makes the code confusing to understand.|
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls and describes the conditions being tested and the results of both calls.  |


- My Overall Grade: **3/6**
- Collegeboard Overall Grade: **3/6**
- Comments: The Collegeboard and I gave the code the same score but where we gave the point is different.
