# Collegeboard Coding Submissions (Part 3)

## Submission 1 

| Reporting Category      | Student Score | Collegeboard Score| Comments |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   1     |   1  | The program runs properly and includes an input and an output. The response explains the purpose and the functionality shown in the video.    |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 0        | 0      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and a list included. The first segment shows data being stored in the identified list but the second does not show the data being accessed from the list.         |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  0    | 0      | The code includes a list and the response explains how it could be written differently (without lists), but the list does not manage complexity in the program.              |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 0        | 0      | The code includes a student developed procedure but the response does not specifically explain how it contributes to the program.           |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 0       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm but it is hard to understand.|
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls and describes the conditions being tested and the results of both calls.  |

- My Overall Grade: **2/6**
- Collegeboard Overall Grade: **3/6**

## Submission 2

| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   1    |   1   | the program runs properly and includes an input and an output. The response explains the purpose and the functionality shown in the video.   |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and a list included. The name of both lists are mentioned and used in the code. The response also mentions what is stored within the list.            |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  1   | 1     | The code uses lists to manage complexity and the response explains why it would be different without the lists.             |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | The code includes a student developed procedure with 1 different perameter that is used in the program and briefly explains the functionality of the procedure.              |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 1       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm however the response does explain how it works so that someone can replicate it.|
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls and describes the conditions being tested and the results of both calls. The results are in detail and specified.  |


- My Overall Grade: **6/6**
- Collegeboard Overall Grade: **6/6**
- Comments: The program was excellent and Collegeboard and I gave it the same score.
