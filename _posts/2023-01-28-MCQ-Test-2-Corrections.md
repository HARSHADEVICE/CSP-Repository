# MCQ Test 2 Corrections

- **Question 17:** I forgot to select 2 answers for this question and just selected 1, silly mistake. The second answer was option D because it said IF Val 1 is not Val 2 it is true else the result is false which is 
 essentially the same thing as option A (the one that I chose).

- **Question 27:** I accidentally put the loop first when it is supposed ot be at the end of the code (n=n+1). This makes it so that the code runs after everything is done.
 Other than that the answers were the exact same.

- **Question 28:** The correct answer was option A instead of option D because the loop for option A it will run the REPEAT 4 TIMES loop which moves the robot 1 square left
and one squre up. Running this 4 times will result in the robot in the grey square.

- **Question 30:** D was obviously wron because r-1 and y-1 would draw the circles below and not above. B is correct because it has r+1 and y+1 which appropriately draws the circles above.

- **Question 40:** B is correct because the robot turns to the right one, two, or three times and then moves one or two squares forward. Therefore, the possible final locations are to the right, below, or to the left of the starting position.
C is wrong because the robot could also turn left 1, 2, or 3 times.

 - **Question 41:** A and D are correct because they both hve a 1/5, or 20 percent chance of voting a canidate. BB is wrong as it does not do that exactly correct.

- **Question 43:** C is correc because computer systems usually have some simplifying assumptions of real world systems or objects.

- **Question 45:** C is correct because a heuristic approach is when a problem cannot be solved in a reasonable time but an approximate solution is accepted.

- **Question 56:** My conversion from hexadecimal to decimal was wrong, so the answer is C (letter V).
