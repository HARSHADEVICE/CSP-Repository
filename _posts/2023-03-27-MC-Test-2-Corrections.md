- **Question 18:** A was correct because you don't need to mention morninglist again but you actually
use afternoonlist. After that you append the variables.


- **Question 30:** The correct answer is C.  A relational expression evaluates to a Boolean value. The value of the variable truckWeight is less than the value of the variable weightLimit, so the relational expression evaluates to true.

- **Question 45:** The correct answer is A. If scoreA is greater than both scoreB and scoreC (the first two IF clauses), then Team A wins. If scoreA is greater than scoreB but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA (the outer ELSE clause) and scoreC (the IF clause in the outer ELSE), then Team B wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins.
