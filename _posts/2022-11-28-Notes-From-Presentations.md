- After defining a list, many functions can be performed using it.
- You can interchange variables by replacing the value of the variable to another variable.
- The float datatype accounts for decimals and the same mathematical function are applicable.
### Data Abstraction
- Data Abstraction seperates the qualities of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.
- AP exam starts index value from 1 and not 0 (like Python).
- You can split and join lists in different ways.
