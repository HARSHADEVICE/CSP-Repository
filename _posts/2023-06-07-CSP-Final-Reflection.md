# Skills that I have obtained

I have obtained many valuable skills from taking APCSP. My knowledge of computer science and even aspects that are not computer science related have increased. For example, I now know how to code in python and javascript.
I know more about how to deploy web applications and use an API. I did not even know what these terms were before taking APCSP. Furthermore, I Learned how to use an sqlite table and implement a database in the projects that I am doing. 
I also learned things that are not computer science related, such as working in a group properly and organizing tasks using a scrum board. CSP taught me to be more collaborative and talk to the people around me if I have problems.
This class taught me **NOT** to procrastinate and do things the day it was assigned, which help me build a solid work ethic. 

# Highs and Lows from the Year

There were many highs and lows from this year in APCSP. Specifically, the highs were when I got the code in the backend to connnect with the frontend. the lows I had was the all nighters that I had to spend working on the project. Reflecting on these highs and lows, I learned to embrace the challange and grind it al out making the best project that I can make.  

# Furture Plans for CS

I want to pursue CS in other ways when I get older. I plan on doing more passion projects next year and the years after that. I plan on working on this project with the people that are closest to me such as myfriends, relatives, and parents. 
My dad is also an engineer so he can help me if I get stuck on anything. Collaborating with others makes me feel happy that it is a group thing rather than an individual work. 

# How can I relate CS with my other passions

I have a passion for finance and would like to relate CS towards that. Furthermore, I would like to implement CS in order to predict which stock to buy and make my own finance related CS projects in my spare time.
