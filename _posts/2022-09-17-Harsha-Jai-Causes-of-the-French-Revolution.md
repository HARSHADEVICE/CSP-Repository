Task \#2

1.  > Using the documents at your table, answer the following questions. Be sure to use the correct source to answer the questions. (You can also find the sources [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcTdFL6-a--iw7V2IHEO_v_YniiaRoUV/view?usp=sharing))

**<span class="underline">Source 1:</span> TIMELINE**

1.  > Using the timeline, name two problems that France faced before the Revolution.

<!-- end list -->

  - > **Poor economic conditions led to an even heavier tax burden on the peasants.**

  - > **Commoners did not have enough to eat and began to riot, demanding bread.**

<!-- end list -->

2.  > What is an absolute ruler and what impact do you think the Enlightenment had on absolute rulers?

**An absolute ruler is a person who has unlimited authority. The enlightenment challenged the existence of absolute power and people believed that humans should have natural rights and believe whatever they want to believe.**

3.  > How might the English and American Revolutions influence the French?

**The English and American Revolution influenced the French because the French people also wanted to stand up for what they believed in and secure their Independence from the rich.**

**<span class="underline">Source 2</span>: IMAGES**

1.  > According to the document, what unfair social conditions existed in pre-revolutionary France?

> **The Middle class people were mostly the only ones that were paying the taxes, with the officials paying little to none of the taxes as shown in the graph. Additionally, the amount of land owned to the amount of people in France is largely unbalanced. This is shown in the graph where 90% of the population (middle class people) own 60% of the land while 10% of the population (rich people) own 40% of the land.**

2.  > What is the cartoonist saying about the relationship among the three estates?

> **The cartoonist is saying that the 1st and 2nd estate have nothing to worry about in life and they are getting all they want without contributing anything. However, the 3rd estate contributed all of the taxes regardless of their wealth. This says that the estates are largely divided, favoring the 1st and 2nd estates.**

3.  > How would you feel if you were a French citizen in the Third Estate?

> **I would feel very angry and most likely rebel against the government. I would try and protest in every way possible.**

**<span class="underline">Source 3:</span> QUOTES**

1.  > Briefly summarize (using a few words) the major issue or condition each author is describing in each quote.

<!-- end list -->

1.  > Common people are taxed heavily while the rich do not have to pay taxes.

2.  > The poor people are basically slums with ragged clothes.

> C. The price of food is continually increasing, causing the common people to worry.

2\. Which issue listed above do you think had the greatest influence on the people of France?

I think the thing that influenced the French people was the difference in taxes between the poor and the rich. This is because the people feel betrayed and heartbroken by the state of their country and that all these situations would be resolved if the rich paid a good amount of taxes.

Historical question: **What caused the French Revolution?**

Acting as an historian, jot down some ideas you have below for why the people of France revolted. Support your conclusions with examples from the documents.

  - > The people of France revolted due to the large differences in the amount of taxes that they have to pay. According to source 2, the amount of taxes that the middle class pay is 50% while the rich do not even pay 10% for taxes.

  - > The idea of an absolute ruler seemed to anger many of the French people. According to source 1, it depicts a poor person who is standing while the clergy and the rich are riding on top. This says that the rich are taking advantage of the poor.
