- **Question 24:** I missed looked at the amount of seconds it took to do each operation. Therefore, I picked the wrong option. I should have chosen sorting instead of deleting data.
- **Question 39:**  The first number displayed must be 1. The second number displayed could be 1 or 2. The third number displayed could be 1, 2, or 3. The last number displayed could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 1 2 3 4 is a possible output. I went about it wrong. 
- **Question 40:** The first call to RANDOM returns a random integer from 1 to 3, inclusive. The second call to RANDOM returns a random integer from 2 to 5, inclusive. The third call to RANDOM returns a random integer from 4 to 8, inclusive. Therefore, the least possible sum is 1 + 2 + 4, or 7, and the greatest possible sum is 3 + 5 + 8, or 16.
- **Question 49:**  This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a studentâ€™s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped.
