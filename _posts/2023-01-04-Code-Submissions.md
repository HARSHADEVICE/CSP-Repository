# Collegeboard Coding Submissions 

## Submission 1 

| Reporting Category      | Student Score | Collegeboard Score| Comments |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   1     |   0   | The program runs properly and the response is based on the functionality of the program. Additionally, the program describes the functionality (getting all the trig values) of itself.         |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and does assist in fulfilling the program's purpose.             |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  0    | 0      |  The program includes a list that collects 4 possible clarifications in one place, but that is not needed for this program. That makes this program inefficient.               |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | The program includes a student developed procedure that correctly describes the function of the program. It also works as it is supposed to and contributes to the program.                |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 1       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm and the response tells how the algorithm works in detail.   |
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls which the user inputs the side lengths and identifies the results of each call.  |

| Row 1: Program Response and Function      |   1     |   1  | The program runs properly and the response is based on the functionality of the program. The response clarifies the purpose to the user.        |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      |  The program had 2 indentifiable segments and does assist in fulfilling the program's purpose. The name of the list is identified as startgrid.            |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity  |  1    | 1     | The response includes a list to manage complexity by accessing and storing the status (1 or 0) and the response explains how the code could be written without the list.              |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | The program includes a student developed procedure that correctly describes the function of the program . It also works as it is supposed to and contributes to the program.                |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation   | 1       |  1     | The program includes a student developed algorithm (includes sequencing and iteration) and the response tells how the algorithm works in detail.   |
| Row 6: Testing   | 1       |  1     | The response shows 2 calls which the user inputs the side lengths and identifies the results of each call.|
