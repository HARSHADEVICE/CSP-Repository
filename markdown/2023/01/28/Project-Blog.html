<ul>
  <li>Our project and projects (Individual Things) must follow all CPT criteria listed by collegeboard. This includes correct program functionality, data abstraction
(showing that the data has been stored), Managing complexity (efficently done code), Procedural Abstraction (inlcuding multiple student developed procedures), 
Algorithm Implementation (an Algorithm that incldues sequencing, selection, and iteration), and Testing (including 2 calls and description of the conditions tested in each procedure).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I am making a parametric recipe finder which finds recipies based on people’s ingredients in their house and other criteria. I wil use an API to do this by finding a good API
(which I have already found), and  code to link the fornten to the backend. The program completes all of collegeboard’s requirements because it is efficient, complete, has an algorithm, and would have been tested multiple times.
in the video, I will have multiple people input ingredients they have at home and the API will output back recipies that they can make that fulfills what they want.
The code that calls the API and links it to the user’s input will be demoed in the video.</li>
</ul>
