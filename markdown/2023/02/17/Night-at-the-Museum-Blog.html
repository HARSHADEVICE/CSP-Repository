  <li>Night at the Musuem yesterday (2/17/2023) was a fun experience for me because I was able to see all sorts of projects from different classes. I liked all the different
 projects that every class did. Here are some classes that I visited in Night at the Museum.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3D Animation:</strong> This is from 3D Animation and their project was about animating a donut in a table. It was pretty cool as I got to see many projects in many 
different themes and styles. Additionally, many people also made other animations containing other things including cartoons.</p>

<p><strong>Photography 1-2:</strong> There was a vareity of different photographs from students in photogrphy 1-2. This contained photos of the sun, the track at out school, and many more.
I also liked how they used different settings/shadings to make it better.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Media Arts:</strong> The students at digital media arts made a film trailer for their film that we all can see by  scanning the QR Code below. I saw some of them and they were very cool.</p>

<p>Overall, Night at the Musuem was a very fun and informative experience for me. I also had people try my parametic recipe finder. They liked it and it was pretty cool.</p>
