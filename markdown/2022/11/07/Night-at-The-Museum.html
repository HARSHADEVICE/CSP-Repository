<p>I realy liked Night at the Museum. It was a cool and unique way to show off what we have learned in all of our classes. I saw other projects in APCSP, AP Studio Art, and 3D Animation. Overall, here was my experience for all of my classes.</p>

<p><strong>AP Studio Art</strong>: I saw all sorts of different drawings made by students. Each drawing had a different style to it and I liked most/all of them. People used different styles and I liked most if not all of them. I liked the impressive amount of creativity that the students showed.</p>

<p><strong>3D Animation</strong>: The projects in 3D Animation really impressed me because there was a ton of different styles that people used. There was all sorts of textures that students used to impress viewers. Some people had sort of a videogameish animation (the picture below), and others had like a donut box and a cool animation to display the donut and table. I was very impressed with their designs.</p>

<p><strong>Progress for Next Trimester</strong>: My progress for next tri is that I will add more styling to my website as frontend and learn more css and html. Additionally, I will add stuff that makes the website look better designed, professional, and sleek.</p>
