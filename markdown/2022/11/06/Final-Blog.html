<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> I made a mistake because the code multiplies the result by 5 a total of 3 times rather than multiplying 5 a total of 3 times. I misinterpreted the meaning of “repeat” which made me think it was multiplying by 3 times rather than 5. D is the correct answer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question 43:</strong> I made a mistake because the code iterates until x&gt;5, which made me forget the last iteration (+5). Therefore, the answer should be 15 instead of 10. C is the correct answer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question 35:</strong> I needed to choose 2 options and forgot to choose the other one. Option A (the one I did not choose) sets maxPS to 50 by default and then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120. This works/functions correctly as well. A and D are the correct answers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question 16</strong> I did not know that the packets can be sent in any order but still be reassembled by the recipients device. B is the correct answer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Question 48</strong> The value of y is changed to 75 after the 5th line. I did not know this and assumed it was still 50. C is the correct answer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
