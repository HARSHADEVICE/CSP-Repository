<p>My partner Raunak and I created an Applab <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/6TmfHYt7qkPd1WumAI3dkp8m1V7Ipoj_lA3-09HnZ3g">quiz</a> on <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> on the capitals of the world. Here are the challenges that we had to go through and personal learnings that I had when creating this quiz.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#ideas-for-applab-quiz-topics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ideas for Applab Quiz (Topics)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Space</li>
  <li>Capitals (We ended up choosing this one)</li>
  <li>School Subjects</li>
  <li>Foods Favorites</li>
  <li>Sports Places</li>
  <li>Vacation Spots</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenges">
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We were wondering how to score the quiz. We discussed and figured it out by adding a variable called score and making it increase by 1 everytime the user got a question right. In the end, we printed out how much the user got right by printing the score variable.</li>
  <li>We did not know how to make the quiz move on to the next screen after the question. We solved this problem by making a command that when the user clicks the right answer, it moves on to the next (correct) screen. We used the block function to help us do this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="designerrors">
<a class="anchor" href="#designerrors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design/Errors:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We implemented images and customized buttons to suit our theme, capitals. We did this by searching up and uploading images for all the questions and pages displayed on the quiz. 
For the buttons, we changed the color and the font to better suit our theme.</li>
  <li>We had a few errors during testing, particularly moving the quiz to the next screen. We fixed this by modifying the blocks to the correct order of screens.</li>
  <li>We had screens showing up multiple times, which made our quiz wrong and inefficient, so we modified the blocks again to fix this.</li>
  <li>The buttons did not work sometimes and had the fucntions wrong, which made our quiz not work, we fixed this by redoing all the buttons, which helped us “reset” the way the quiz was done and get it to work.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="successes">
<a class="anchor" href="#successes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Successes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>After a few trials testing the quiz, we got it to work efficiently. The screens came exactly in order and the score was displayed correctly.</li>
  <li>The questions and each screen was printed no more than once and the quiz is correctly customized to suit the capitals theme.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discoveries">
<a class="anchor" href="#discoveries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discoveries:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We learned how to use Applab to design a quiz. Specifically, using the blocks gave us a different idea on how we should generally approach making a program. 
I got to learn how the computer “thinks” as it processes our code. Overall, from this project, we both learned how to approach in making a program and how to be more logical/methodical when coding.</li>
</ul>
