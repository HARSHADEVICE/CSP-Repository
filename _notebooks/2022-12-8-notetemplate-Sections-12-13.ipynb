    "Procedure: Named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.\n",

    "Parameters: Input values of a procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Separating a program's functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Abstraction: One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some other names for procedures?: Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "- When we define procedures in python, we used \"def.\"\n",
    "- A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure.\n",

    "## <mark>Homework/Hacks</mark>: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
